<p>Steps showing simplification of [– (a + b)].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The expression [– (a + b)] equal to [–1(a + b)] which is further equal to [(–1)(a) + (–1)(b)] obtained by applying the distributive property. The expression [–1(a + b)] has two arrows with it; pointing from [1] towards the terms [a] and [b] of the binomial.</li>
<li> Line 2: Simplification of  Line 1 results into [–a – b]. </li>
