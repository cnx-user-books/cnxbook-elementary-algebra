<h1>Product of two polynomial expressions</h1>
<p>A problem showing [x^2 + 4] multiplying [x^2 + 7x + 2].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [x^2 + 4] and [x^2 + 7x + 2] equal to [x^2*x^2 + x^2*7x + x^2*2 + 4*x^2 + 4*7x+4*2] obtained by applying FOIL method.  The expression [(x^2 + 4) (x^2 + 7x + 2)] has six arrows with it. The first set of three arrows are originating from [x^2], and the second set of three arrows are  originating from [4]. All these six arrows are pointing towards the terms [x^2], [7x], and [2] of the second polynomial.</li>
<li> Line 2: Simplification of  Line 1 results into [x^4 + 7x^3 + 2x^2 + 4x^2 + 28x + 8] </li>
<li> Line 3: After combining third and fourth term of the expression in the Line 2, expression simplifies to [x^4 + 7x^3 + 6x^2 + 28x + 8]</li>
 </ul>
