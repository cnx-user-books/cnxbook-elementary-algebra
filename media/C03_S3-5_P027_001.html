<h1>Product of two binomial expressions</h1>
<p>A problem showing [a + 6] multiplying [a + 3].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [a + 6] and [a + 3] equal to [a*a + a*3 + 6*a + 6*3] obtained by applying FOIL method. The expression [(a + 6) (a + 3)] has four arrows with it. Two arrows pointing from [a] and another two arrows pointing from [6] towards the terms [a] and [3] of the second binomial.</li>
<li>Explanation for FOIL is given on the right side as F represents the product [a*a] of first terms, O represents the product [3*a] of outer terms, I represents the product [6*a] of inner terms, L represents the product [6*3] of last terms.</li>
<li> Line 2: Simplification of  Line 1 results into [a^2 + 3a + 6a + 18] </li>
<li> Line 3: Combining second and third term of the expression in the Line 2, expression simplifies to [a^2 + 18a + 18]</li>
 </ul>
