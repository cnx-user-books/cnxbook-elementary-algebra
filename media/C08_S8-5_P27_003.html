<h1>Product of expressions containing square roots</h1>
<p>A problem showing [4*2^(1/2)-3*6^(1/2)] multiplying [5*2^(1/2)+6^(1/2)].</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 1: The expression [(4*2^(1/2)-3*6^(1/2)) (5*2^(1/2)+6^(1/2))] having four arrows with it. The first set of two arrows are originating from [4*2^(1/2)]. The second set of two arrows are originating from [3*6^(1/2)]. These arrows are pointing towards the terms [5^(1/2)] and [6^(1/2)].</li>                                                                      <li>Line 2: [4*5*2^(1/2)*2^(1/2)+4*2^(1/2)*6*(1/2) – 3*5*6^(1/2)*2^(1/2)+3*6^(1/2)*6^(1/2)] is obtained by applying the distributive property. </li>
<li>Line 3: Simplifiction of the expression of Line 2 results into [20*4^(1/2)+4*12^(1/2)-15*12^(1/2)-3*36^(1/2)]. This is obtained by applying product property of square roots.</li>                                                       
<li>Line 4: Simplification of the radicals in the expression of Line 3 results into [20*2+4*(4*3)^(1/2)-15*(4*3)^(1/2)-3*6].</li>                                                                   <li>Line 5: Further simplification of the radicals involving perfect squares expression in the Line 4 results into [40+8*3^(1/2)-30*3^(1/2)-18].</li>                                                                                           <li>Line 6: Simplifying the expression of Line 5 the expression results into [22-22^(1/2)]or [22(1-3^(1/2))] which can not be simplified further.</li>
