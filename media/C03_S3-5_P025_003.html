<h1>Multiplying polynomial by a monomial</h1>
<p>A problem showing [x – 7] multiplying [x].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [x – 7] and [x] equal to [x*x + x*(–7)] obtained by applying the distributive property. The expression [(x – 7)x] has two arrows with it; pointing from [x] towards the terms [x] and [7] of the binomial.</li>
<li> Line 2: Simplification of  Line 1 results into [x^2 – 7x]. </li>
 </ul>
