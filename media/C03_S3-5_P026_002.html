<h1>Multiplying polynomial by a polynomial</h1>
<p>Steps showing simplification of [(a + b)(c +d)] .</p>
<ul>
 <li>  The product of [a + b] and [c + d] equal to [ac + ad + bc + bd] obtained by applying the FOIL method. The expression [(a + b)(c + d)] has four arrows with it. Two arrows pointing towards [c] one from a labeled as ‘F’ and another from [b] labeled as ‘I’. Another two arrows pointing towards [d] one from [a] labeled as ‘O’ and another from [b] labeled as ‘L’. Terms of the expression are labeled as F, O, I, L from left to right to show  that they are the products of  first terms, outer terms, inner terms, and last terms,  respectively</li>
