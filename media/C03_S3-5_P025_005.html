<h1>Multiplying polynomial by a monomial</h1>
<p>A problem showing [4x^2y^7z] multiplying [x^5y + 8y^2z^2].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [4x^2y^7z] and [x^5y + 8y^2z^2] equal to [4x^2y^7z *x^5y + 4x^2y^7z *8y^2z^2]. This is obtained by applying the distributive property. The expression [4x^2y^7z(x^5y + 8y^2z^2)] has two arrows originating from [4x^2y^7z] and pointing towards the terms [x^5y] and [8y^2z^2] of the binomial.</li>
<li> Line 2: Simplification of  Line 1 results into [4x^7y^8z + 32x^2y^9z^3]. </li>
 </ul>
