<h1>Product of expressions containing square roots</h1>
<p>A problem showing [6^(1/2)] multiplying [2^(1/2)-10^(1/2)].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [6^(1/2)] and [2^(1/2)-10^(1/2)] is equal to [6^(1/2)*2^(1/2)-6^(1/2)*10^(1/2)]. This is obtained by applying the distributive property. The expression [6^(1/2)(2^(1/2)-10^(1/2))] has two arrows with it that are originating from [6^(1/2)], and pointing towards the terms [2^(1/2)] and [10^(1/2)].</li>
<li> Line 2: By applying the product property of square roots Line 1 simplifies to [12^(1/2)-60^(1/2)]</li>
<li> Line 3: Factoring the radicand [12] and [60] of the resultant expression of Line 2 as [4*3] and [4* 15],the expression results into [(4*3)^(1/2)+(4*15)^(1/2)]. </li>
 <li> Line 4: Simplifying [(4*3)^(1/2)] and [(4*15)^(1/2)] which have the perfect square [4] in the radicand, Line 3 simplifies to [2*3^(1/2)+2*15^(1/2)] which can not be simplified further</li>
</ul>
