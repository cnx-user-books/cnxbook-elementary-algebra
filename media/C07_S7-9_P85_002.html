<p>Steps of long division problem showing [x+3] dividing [x^3+4x^2+x-1].</p>
<ul>
  <li> Step 1: The original problem: [x+3] dividing [x^3+4x^2+x-1] with the quotient [x^2].</li>
  <li> Step 2: The result of the the quotient, [x^2],  multiplied by the divisor, [x+3], is [x^3+3x^2]. <li> Step 3: The result of Line 1 minus Line 2 is [x^2+x+1]. </li>
<li> Step 4: The result of the second term of the quotient, [x], multiplied by the divisor, [x + 3], is [x^2 + 3x]. </li>
<li> Step 5: The result of Line 3 minus Line 4 is [-2x-1]. </li>
<li> Step 6: The result of the third term of the quotient, [-2], multiplied by the divisor, [x + 3], is [-2x-6]. </li>
<li> Step 7: The result of Line 5 minus Line 6 is the remainder [5]. </li>
 </ul>
