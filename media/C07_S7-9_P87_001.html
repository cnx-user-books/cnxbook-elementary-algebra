<p>Steps of  long division problem showing [x+6] dividing [2x^3+0x^2-4x+1]</p>
<ul>
  <li> Step 1: The original problem: [x+6] dividing [2x^3+0x^2-4x+1] </li>
  <li> Step 2: The result of the the quotient, [2x^2],  multiplied by the divisor, [x+6], is [-2x^3+12x^2]. 
  <li> Step 3: The result of Line 1 minus Line 2 is [-12x^2-4x+1]. </li>
<li> Step 4: There is an arrow originating from [x] in the divisor's place, and pointing to [-12x^2] of the expression [-12x^2-4x+1]. </li>
<li> Step 5: The result of the second term of the quotient, [-12x], multiplied by the divisor, [x + 6], is [-12x^2-72x+1]. </li>
<li> Step 6: The result of Line 3 minus Line 4 is [68x+1]. </li>
<li> Step 7: There is an arrow originating from [x] in the divisor's place, and pointing to [68x] of the expression [68x+408]. </li>
<li> Step 8: The result of the third term of the quotient, [68], multiplied by the divisor, [x + 6], is [68x+408]. </li>
<li> Step 9: The result of Line 5 minus Line 6 is the remainder [-407]. </li>
 </ul>
