<h1>Multiplying polynomial by a monomial</h1>
<p>A problem showing [8a^2] multiplying [3a^4 – 5a^3 + a].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [8a^2] and [3a^4 – 5a^3 + a] equal to [8a^2*3a^4 + 8a^2( – 5a^3) + 8a^2*a]. This is obtained by applying the distributive property. The expression [8a^2(3a^4 – 5a^3 + a)] has three arrows originating from [8a^2], and pointing towards the terms [3a^4], [5a^3] and [a] of the trinomial.</li>
<li> Line 2: Simplification of  Line 1 results into [24a^6  – 40a^5 + 8a^3]. </li>
 </ul>
