<h1>Product of two binomial expressions</h1>
<p>A problem showing [a – 4] multiplying [a – 3].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [a – 4] and [a – 3] equal to [a*a + a*(–3) – 4*a – 4*(–3)] obtained by applying FOIL method. The expression [(a – 4) (a – 3)] has four arrows with it. The first set of two arrows are originating from [a], and the second set of two arrows are originating from [4]. All these four arrows are pointing towards the terms [a] and [3] of the second binomial.</li>
<li>Explanation for FOIL is given on the right side. F represents the product [a*a] of the first terms, O represents the product [a*(–3)] of the outer terms, I represents the product [(– 4)*a] of the inner terms, and L represents the product [(–4)*(–3)] of the last terms.</li>
<li> Line 2: Simplification of  Line 1 results into [a^2 – 3a – 4a + 12] </li>
<li> Line 3: After combining second and third term of the expression in the Line 2, expression simplifies to [a^2 – 7a + 12]</li>
 </ul>
