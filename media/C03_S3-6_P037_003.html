<h1>Fill in the missing label in the equaton.</h1>
<p>An equation showing product of binomials: [(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2].</p>
<ul>
 <li>There are arrows showing the relation among the terms of the binomials being mulitplied and the resultant bionomials. Arrows showing the relation between the first term of the binomial [a + b] and the first term of the resultant binomial [a^2 - b^2]are not labeled. Similarly, arrows showing the relation between the second term of the  binomial [a + b] and the second term of the resultant binomial [a^2 - b^2] are not labeled. The sign in the resultant binomial [a^2 - b^2] is labeled as "Minus".</li>
