<h1>Product of two binomial expressions</h1>
<p>A problem showing [4x + 3] multiplying [5x + 2].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [4x + 3] and [5x + 2] equal to [4x*5x + 4x*2 + 3*5x + 3*2] obtained by applying FOIL method. The expression [(a + 6) (a + 3)] has four arrows with it.</li>
<li> Line 2: Simplification of  Line 1 results into [20x^2 + 8x + 15x + 6] </li>
<li> Line 3: Combining second and third term of the expression in the Line 2, expression simplifies to [20x^2 + 23x + 6]</li>
<li> There is a curly brace under the expression in the Line 2 covering [8x + 15x] connected to the curly brace over the expression in Line 1 covering the term [23x] showing that combining the like terms [8x] and [15x] results into [23x]. </li>
 </ul>
