<ul>
  <li> Line 1: The original problem: [0.00032] dividing [12]. There is a comment ‘The divisor has [5] decimal place.’ written on the right side of the problem.</li>
 <li> Line 2: [0.00032] dividing [12.00000]. There are two curved arrows, one below the fractional part of [0.00032], and the other below the factional part of  [12.00000]. There is another comment ‘Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend [5] places to the right. We will need to add [5] zeros to [12].’ written on the right side of the problem.</li>
<li> Line 3: A comment 'Set the decimal place and divide' written on the right side.</li>
<li> Line 4: Quotient: [37500] </li>
 <li> Line 5: [32] dividing [1200000].</li>
<li>  Line 6: The result of the digit [3] of the quotient, [37500], multiplied by the divisor, [32], is [96]. </li>
<li> Line 7: The result of Line 5 minus Line 6 is [240]. </li>
<li> Line 8: The result of the digit [7] of the quotient, [37500], multiplied by the divisor, [32], is [224].</li>
<li> Line 9: The result of Line 7 minus Line 8 is the [160]. </li>
<li> Line 10:The result of the digit [5] of the quotient, [37500], multiplied by the divisor, [32], is [160].</li>
