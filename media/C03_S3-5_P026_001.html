<h1>Multiplying polynomial by a polynomial</h1>
<p>Steps showing simplification of [(a + b)(c +d)] .</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [a + b] and [c + d] equal to [(a + b)c + (a + b)d]. This is obtained by applying the distributive property. The expression [(a + b)(c + d)] has two arrows originating from the curly brace under [a + b], and pointing towards the terms [c] and [d] of the binomial. Each term of the expression [(a + b)c + (a + b)d] has two arrows with it. The first set of arrows are originating from [c], pointing towards [a + b]. The second set of arrows are originating from [d] and pointing towards [a + b].</li>
<li> Line 2: Simplification of  Line 1 results into [ac + ad + bc + bd]. </li>
 </ul>
