<h1>Product of expressions containing square roots</h1>
<p>A problem showing [7^(1/2)] multiplying [8^(1/2)-3].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [7^(1/2)] and [8^(1/2)-3] equal to  [7^(1/2)*8^(1/2)-7^(1/2)*3] obtained by applying the distributive property. The expression [7^(1/2)(8^(1/2)-3)] has two arrows with it; pointing from [7^(1/2)] towards the terms [8^(1/2)] and [3].                                                       <li> Line 2: Simplifying expression of Line 1 the expression results into [56^(1/2)-3*7^(1/2)]. There is a comment 'Simply [56^(1/2)]' on the right side.</li>
 <li> Line 3: Simplifying first term [56^(1/2)] of line 2 as [(4*14)^(1/2)] the expression results into [(4*14)^(1/2)-3*7^(1/2)]. </li>                                <li> Line 4: Simplifying [(4*14)^(1/2)] which have the perfect square [4] in the radicand, Line 3 simplifies to [2*14^(1/2)-3*7^(1/2) which can not be simplified further </li>
</ul>
