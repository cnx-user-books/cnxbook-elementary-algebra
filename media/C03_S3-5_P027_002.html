<h1>Product of two binomial expressions</h1>
<p>A problem showing [x + y] multiplying [2x + 4y].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [x + y] and [2x + 4y] equal to [x*2x + x*4y + y*2x + y*4y] obtained by applying FOIL method.  The expression [(x + y) (2x + y)] has four arrows with it. Two arrows pointing from [x] and another two arrows pointing from [y] towards the terms [2x] and [4y] of the second binomial.</li>
<li> Explanation for FOIL is given on the right side as F represents the product [x*2x] of first terms, O represents the product [x*4y] of outer terms, I represents the product [y*2x] of inner terms, L represents the product [y*4y] of last terms.</li>
<li> Line 2: Simplification of  Line 1 results into [2x^2 + 4xy + 2xy + 4y^2] </li>
<li> Line 3: Combining second and third term of the expression in the Line 2, expression simplifies to [2x^2 + 6xy + 4y^2]</li>
 </ul>
