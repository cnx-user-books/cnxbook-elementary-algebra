<h1>Product of expressions containing square roots</h1>
<p>A problem showing [3^(1/2)] multiplying [7+6^(1/2)].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [3^(1/2)] and [7+6^(1/2)] equal to  [7*3^(1/2)+3^(1/2)*6^(1/2)]. This is obtained by applying the distributive property. This expression is equal to [7*3^(1/2)+18^(1/2)], obtained by applying the product property of square roots. The expression [3^(1/2)(7+6^(1/2))] has two arrows with it that are originating from [3^(1/2)] and pointing towards the terms [7] and [6^(1/2)].</li>
<li> Line 2: Factoring the radicand [18] of the resultant expression of Line 1 as [9*2],the expression results into [7*3^(1/2)+(9*2)^(1/2)]. </li>
 <li> Line 3: Simplifying [(9*2)^(1/2)] having the perfect square [9] in the radicand, Line 2 simplifies to [7*3^(1/2)+3*2^(1/2)] which can not be simplified further</li>
</ul>
