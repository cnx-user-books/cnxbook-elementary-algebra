<p>An equation showing square of a binomial: [(a + b)^2 = a^2 +2ab +b^2].</p>
<ul>
 <li>The labeled arrows are showing the relation among the terms of the binomial and the trinomial. Arrows showing the relation between the middle term [2ab] of the trinomial and two terms [a] and [b]of the binomial are labeled as "Double the product of the two terms". Arrows showing the relation between the last term [b] of the binomial and the last term [b^2] trinomial are labeled as "last term squared". Arrows showing the relation between the first term of the binomial [a], and that of the first term [a^2] trinomial are not labeled.</li>
