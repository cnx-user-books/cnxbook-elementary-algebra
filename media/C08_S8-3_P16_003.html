<h1>Product of expressions containing square roots</h1>
<p>A problem showing [(45a^6b^3)^(1/2)] multiplying [(9ab)^(1/2) – (5(b –3)^3)^(1/2)].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [6^(1/2)] and [2^(1/2) –10^(1/2)] is equal to  
[3a^3b(5b)^(1/2)(3(ab)^(1/2) –(b –3)(5(b –3))^(1/2))]. This is obtained by simplifying the radicals having perfect square factors in the radicand.  The expression [3a^3b(5b)^(1/2)(3(ab)^(1/2) –(b –3)(5(b –3))^(1/2))] has two arrows with it that are originating from [3a^3b(5b)^(1/2)] and pointing towards the terms [3(ab)^(1/2)] and [(b-3)(5(b-3)^(1/2))].</li>
<li> Line 2: By applying the distributive property and product property of square roots Line 1 simplifies to [9a^3b(5ab^2)^(1/2) – 3a^3b(b – 3)(25b(b – 3))^(1/2)]
<li> Line 3: By simplifying the radical [(25b(b – 3))^(1/2)] having perfect square factor [25] expression of Line 2 simplifies to [9a^3b^2(5a)^(1/2) –3a^3b(b – 3)5(b(b – 3))^(1/2)].</li>
 <li> Line 4: Simplification of the second term of the Line 3, results into the expression [9a^3b^2(5a)^(1/2) –15a^3b(b – 3)(b(b – 3))^(1/2)] which can not be simplified further.</li>
