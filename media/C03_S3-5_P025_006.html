<h1>Multiplying polynomial by a monomial</h1>
<p>A problem showing [9x^2z + 4w] multiplying [5zw^3].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [9x^2z + 4w] and [5zw^3] equal to [9x^2z*5zw^3 + 4w*5zw^3]. This is obtained by applying the distributive property. The expression [(9x^2z + 4w)( 5zw^3)] has two arrows originating from [5zw^3], and pointing towards the terms [9x^2z] and [4w] of the binomial.</li>
<li> Line 2: Simplification of  Line 1 results into [45x^2z^2w^3 + 20zw^4]. </li>
<li> Line 3: Rearranging the factors in the terms, Line 2 results into [45x^2w^3 z^2 + 20 w^4z]. </li>
 </ul>
