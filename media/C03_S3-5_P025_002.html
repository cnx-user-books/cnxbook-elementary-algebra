<h1>Multiplying polynomial by a monomial</h1>
<p>A problem showing [6] multiplying [x^3 – 2x].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: The product of [6] and [x^3 – 2x] equal to [6(x^3 + (–2x))] which is further equal to [6*x^3 + 6(–2x)] obtained by applying the distributive property. The expression [6(x^3 + (–2x))] has two arrows with it; pointing from [6] towards the terms [x] and [9] of the binomial.</li>
<li> Line 2: Simplification of  Line 1 results into [3x + 27]. </li>
 </ul>
