<title>Summary of Key Concepts</title>

  <md:content-id>m21989</md:content-id><md:title>Summary of Key Concepts</md:title>
  <md:abstract>This module is from Elementary Algebra by Denny Burzynski and Wade Ellis, Jr.
Beginning with the graphical solution of systems, this chapter includes an interpretation of independent, inconsistent, and dependent systems and examples to illustrate the applications for these systems. The substitution method and the addition method of solving a system by elimination are explained, noting when to use each method. The five-step method is again used to illustrate the solutions of value and rate problems (coin and mixture problems), using drawings that correspond to the actual situation.
This module presents a summary of the key concepts of the chapter "Systems of Linear Equations".</md:abstract>
